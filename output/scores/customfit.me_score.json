  "analysis_notes": "This evaluation reveals a CRITICAL ISSUE: **Domain/Entity Confusion**\n\n**THE PROBLEM:**\n\nWhen you visit https://customfit.me, you see:\n- Lehigh CustomFit - established PPE (safety footwear) company\n- 'The big 100' celebration (100 years)\n- B2B managed PPE programs\n- Pennsylvania steel mill heritage\n- Professional, established corporate presence\n\nWhen you search 'customfit.me company', you find:\n- CustomFit.ai - Indian SaaS startup (founded 2017)\n- Website personalization platform\n- $500K-$1.3M revenue, 10-14 employees\n- Bangalore headquarters\n- VC-backed (First Cheque, Java Capital)\n\n**THESE ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COMPANIES.**\n\n**POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:**\n1. CustomFit.ai owns customfit.me but site content is wrong/old\n2. Lehigh CustomFit owns customfit.me and uses it correctly\n3. Domain recently changed hands\n4. SEO/search confusion between similarly-named companies\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR SCORING:**\n\nI cannot accurately score without knowing which company actually operates. Here's why:\n\n**IF CustomFit.ai (startup):**\n- AVOID - Cloud-native SaaS startup, they don't need cloud migration\n- Based in India (time zone/cultural challenges)\n- Too small ($1.3M revenue = tiny IT budget)\n- They BUILD cloud products, wrong target type\n- Score would be: ~25/100 (AVOID)\n\n**IF Lehigh CustomFit (PPE company):**\n- MAYBE - Traditional business with tech (3D scanners, portals)\n- Could need cloud help for scaling online platform\n- Established = likely has budget\n- But: No size/revenue data available\n- No cloud initiative signals\n- Score would be: ~45/100 (LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY)\n\n**CURRENT SCORE: 35/100 (LOW PRIORITY)**\n\nThis reflects:\n- High uncertainty = high risk\n- Limited data availability\n- Either scenario (startup or PPE) has significant downsides\n- Not worth the effort to resolve when other clearer targets exist\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**\n\n**SKIP THIS COMPANY ENTIRELY.**\n\nReasons:\n1. Too much ambiguity to assess properly\n2. Either entity likely wrong fit (startup = cloud-native, PPE = niche/unclear)\n3. No clear cloud need signals from either\n4. Limited contact info available\n5. Time better spent on clearer opportunities\n\n**IF YOU MUST INVESTIGATE:**\n1. WHOIS lookup on customfit.me\n2. Call the phone number on the website (if present)\n3. LinkedIn search for 'Lehigh CustomFit' vs 'CustomFit.ai' employees\n4. Ask directly: 'Are you the Bangalore startup or the PPE company?'\n\nBut honestly? Not worth it. Move to next target.\n\n**LESSON LEARNED:**\n\nThis case shows why due diligence matters. A domain alone isn't enough - need to verify:\n- Company identity matches domain\n- Search results align with website content\n- Entity is actually who they appear to be\n\nFor a 3-person consultancy, time is precious. Don't waste it on ambiguous targets when clear opportunities exist elsewhere in the batch."
