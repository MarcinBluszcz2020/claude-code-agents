  "analysis_notes": "BGSU represents a **CLASSIC UNIVERSITY CLOUD CONSULTING OPPORTUNITY** - which means both potential AND challenges.\n\n**THE UNIVERSITY CLOUD PARADOX:**\n\nUniversities are interesting targets because:\n- ✓ They NEED cloud (research computing, online learning, data storage)\n- ✓ They have BUDGET (government funding + grants + tuition)\n- ✓ They're STABLE (won't go out of business)\n- ✓ They VALUE innovation (academic culture)\n\nBUT:\n- ✗ Procurement is PAINFUL (RFPs, competitive bidding, committees)\n- ✗ Decision-making is SLOW (academic bureaucracy)\n- ✗ Budget is CONSTRAINED (public funding, oversight)\n- ✗ They often have INTERNAL IT (ITS department may resist outsourcing)\n\n**BGSU SPECIFICALLY:**\n\n**PROS:**\n- Tier-one research university (has research computing needs)\n- Computer Science teaches cloud (understands value)\n- BGSU Online (cloud infrastructure opportunity)\n- Research programs (water quality, opioid crisis) = data-intensive\n- Ohio location (closer to your market than international)\n\n**CONS:**\n- No cloud job postings (not actively building cloud team)\n- ITS department exists (may handle internally)\n- Public university procurement (requires RFP compliance)\n- Already using Microsoft cloud (OneDrive/O365 = Azure ecosystem)\n\n**REALISTIC OPPORTUNITIES:**\n\n**1. Research Computing (BEST BET)**\n- Many university researchers need cloud for data processing\n- AWS has research credit programs (free compute for research)\n- Faculty often lack cloud expertise\n- **YOUR ANGLE:** 'We help researchers leverage AWS research credits'\n- **CONTACT:** Find faculty in sciences doing data-heavy research\n- **PROS:** Can bypass procurement for small projects, direct to faculty\n- **CONS:** Small contracts, grant-dependent\n\n**2. AWS Training for CS Department (ENTRY POINT)**\n- CS teaches cloud but may lack hands-on AWS expertise\n- **YOUR ANGLE:** Guest lectures, workshops, AWS certification prep\n- **CONTACT:** CS department chair or cloud computing professor\n- **PROS:** Easy entry, builds relationship, low bureaucracy\n- **CONS:** Low/no revenue, time investment\n\n**3. Grant Partnership (LONG GAME)**\n- Faculty write grants requiring cloud infrastructure\n- **YOUR ANGLE:** 'Include us in grant as cloud consulting partner'\n- **PROS:** Large projects if grant funds, multi-year engagements\n- **CONS:** Grant success rate ~10-20%, very slow timeline\n\n**4. Formal RFP Response (HARD MODE)**\n- Wait for ITS to post cloud migration RFP\n- Compete against big vendors (IBM, Accenture, etc.)\n- **PROS:** Large contract if you win\n- **CONS:** 3-person firm unlikely to win vs. enterprise vendors\n\n**SCORE: 48/100 (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**\n\nThis reflects:\n- Real cloud needs exist (16/25 cloud need score)\n- Financially stable (20/30 stability)\n- BUT: Accessibility is terrible (4/10)\n- AND: Fit is challenging (10/20)\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY - But pursue strategically:**\n\n**DO:**\n- Explore research computing angle (best ROI)\n- Offer free AWS workshop to CS department (relationship building)\n- Connect with individual faculty, not ITS bureaucracy\n- Position around AWS research credits (added value)\n\n**DON'T:**\n- Chase big ITS contracts (you'll lose to enterprise vendors)\n- Expect fast decisions (university timeline = 6-12 months minimum)\n- Invest heavily without inside champion\n\n**BEST STRATEGY:**\n\nBGSU could be a **SIDE OPPORTUNITY** - not primary focus, but worth a low-effort approach:\n\n1. LinkedIn: Find CS faculty teaching cloud computing\n2. Email: 'Free AWS workshop for your students?'\n3. If they bite: Deliver workshop, build relationship\n4. Then: 'Any research projects needing cloud help?'\n5. Leverage: Faculty champion can unlock research computing opportunities\n\nThis avoids procurement hell while potentially accessing grant-funded projects.\n\n**REALITY CHECK:**\n\nFor a 3-person consultancy with day jobs:\n- Universities are SLOW (months to years)\n- Revenue per hour invested is LOW\n- BUT: Can be steady, long-term clients once relationship exists\n\n**BETTER TARGETS:**\n- Private companies (faster decisions)\n- 50-500 employee range (budget + accessibility)\n- Companies actively hiring cloud engineers (clear need signal)\n\nBGSU is worth a LIGHT TOUCH approach but not aggressive pursuit."
