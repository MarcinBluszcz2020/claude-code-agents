  "analysis_notes": "Procore Technologies is a TEXTBOOK example of the WRONG target for your consulting firm. Here's why:\n\n1. **They're cloud-native, not cloud-curious**: Procore IS a cloud company. They build their entire business on AWS. They don't need migration help - they could teach migration.\n\n2. **AWS Strategic Partner**: They have a multi-year strategic collaboration with AWS announced in Aug 2025. This is the HIGHEST tier of partnership - they're co-investing with AWS on AI and construction tech innovation. You're trying to sell AWS expertise to someone who's AWS's strategic partner.\n\n3. **Scale mismatch**: 4,200 employees vs your 3. Public company with $1.2B revenue vs early-stage boutique. They have hundreds of engineers; you have 3 consultants with day jobs.\n\n4. **Business model mismatch**: They BUILD cloud products. You CONSULT on cloud. They're not a potential client - they're in the same ecosystem but different segment.\n\n5. **Procurement nightmare**: As a public company, they have enterprise vendor processes, legal reviews, compliance requirements. The overhead of becoming their vendor would be prohibitive for a 3-person firm.\n\n**VERDICT**: Total mismatch. Score of 12/100 (mostly for being financially stable and having good reputation). Recommendation: AVOID.\n\n**What you SHOULD look for instead**: \n- Traditional businesses (manufacturing, retail, healthcare) with 50-500 employees\n- Companies TALKING about cloud migration in job posts\n- Private companies, Series A-C funded or bootstrapped profitable\n- Companies where you can reach decision-makers directly\n- Businesses that are tech-enabled but not tech companies\n\nProcore is impressive, but completely wrong for your business model."
